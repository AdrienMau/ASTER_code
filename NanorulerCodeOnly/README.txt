This uses Python 3.7. 
To reproduce data, simply open and launch Clathrine_clustering_Process_and_plot.py. 

This code proceed in two steps: 
	An analysis step, with cluster analysis that isolate each cluster and calculate data. 
	A plot step, where ClusterAnalysis.py object is used to plot data in a generic manner. Filtering on radius can be done here.

Caliper_Feret.py is general functions to calculate parameters from a dataset of points.
